I forgot to mention that the server has a service for people who are too brain fried that they cannot write an ID in the moment. You just need to type @image describer. So I was thinking about adding a message like "If you have trouble writing an ID right now, you can write @image describer and someone will write the ID for you". And also maybe something like "If you don't remember how to write IDs, you can visit this our guide on the image-descriptions channel".
